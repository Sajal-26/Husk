## ‚ö†Ô∏è Python Compatibility

**‚ö†Ô∏è This project requires Python `3.10`**

Due to dependency issues (notably with `simpleaudio` and `pipwin`), the project does **not work properly on Python 3.11+**.  
Ensure you are using **Python 3.10 (64-bit)** to avoid runtime and installation errors.

You can download Python 3.10 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).
